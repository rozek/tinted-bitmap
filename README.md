# tinted-bitmap #

creates a tinted copy of a given HTML Image

**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/tinted-bitmap/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

## Installation ##

`tinted-bitmap` may be used as an ESM, CommonJS or AMD module or from a global variable.

You may either install the package into your build environment using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) with the command

```
npm install tinted-bitmap
```

or load the plain script file directly (together with its dependency, the [javascript-interface-library](https://github.com/rozek/javascript-interface-library))

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/javascript-interface-library"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tinted-bitmap"></script>
```

## Access ##

How to access the package depends on the type of module you prefer

* ESM: `import { tintedBitmap, tintedBitmapAsURL } from 'tinted-bitmap'`
* CommonJS: `const tintedBitmap = require('tinted-bitmap')`
* AMD: `require(['tinted-bitmap'], (tintedBitmap) => {...})`

Alternatively, you may access the global variable `tintedBitmap` directly.

## Usage within Svelte ##

For Svelte it is recommended to import the package within a module context:

```
<script context="module">
  import { tintedBitmapAsURL } from 'tinted-bitmap'
</script>

<script>
  let originalImage, tintedImageURL

  function tintOriginalImage () {
    tintedImageURL = tintedBitmapAsURL(originalImage,'limegreen')
  }

  $: if (originalImage != null) {
    if (originalImage.complete) {
      tintOriginalImage()
    } else {
      originalImage.addEventListener('load', tintOriginalImage)
    }
  }
</script>

<img bind:this={originalImage} style="vertical-align:middle" alt="original" src="..."/>
&nbsp; âž” &nbsp;
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src={tintedImageURL} alt="tinted"/>
```

You will find this example in a [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/2cee91ac75a74bc18f77e94f28e0c16d) - feel free to play with it!

## Usage as an ECMAscript Module ##

```
<script>
  import { tintedBitmapAsURL } from 'tinted-bitmap'

  let originalImage  = ...
  let tintedImageURL = tintedBitmapAsURL(originalImage,'limegreen')
</script>
```

## Usage as a CommonJS or AMD Module (or as a global Variable) ##

Let's assume that you already "required" or "imported" (or simply loaded) the module according to your local environment. In that case, you may use it as follows:

```
const tintedBitmapAsURL = tintedBitmap.tintedBitmapAsURL
  
let originalImage  = ...
let tintedImageURL = tintedBitmapAsURL(originalImage,'limegreen')
```

## Background Information ##

Sometimes it is necessary to draw a given (often b/w) raster image in a different color. `tinted-bitmap` performs the necessary "tinting" of such a bitmap and may construct either the data URL for the result (which is often preferred as it may be directly assigned to the `src` attribute of a given HTML image element) or the result itself (as an instance of `HTMLImageElement`)

### JavaScript API ###

This package offers the following named JavaScript exports (function signatures are given with TypeScript type annotations, JavaScript programmers may just ignore them):

* **`tintedBitmap (Bitmap:HTMLImageElement, TintColor:string):HTMLImageElement`** - `tintedBitmap` takes a given HTML image element "`Bitmap`" (which must be `complete`, i.e. completely loaded), uses its alpha channel to create another image in the given `TintColor` (which must be a valid CSS color specification) and returns that image as an `HTMLImageElement`
* **`tintedBitmapAsURL (Bitmap:HTMLImageElement, TintColor:string):string`** - `tintedBitmapAsURL` takes a given HTML image element "`Bitmap`" (which must be `complete`, i.e. completely loaded) and uses its alpha channel to create another image in the given `TintColor` (which must be a valid CSS color specification). The contents of that bitmap are returned as a data URL
